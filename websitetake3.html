     <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
     <P>Producer and graphic designer bounds' melancholy and avant garde design style interprets the low points in life of the "bounds" inbetween the leaps with introspective expression through downtemp and ambient music as well as a nostalgia ridden digital design</P>
     <br>
     <p>bound's upcoming projects explore the memories and feelings that revolve around periods of growth during the developmental times in our lives.</p>
     <p> from contemplative pieces that help us reflect and understand, to hard hitting selections that help us realize how cold life can sometimes be and the harshness of understanding</p>
     <br>
     <p>Born and raised in Houston, Texas, bounds realized his artistic integrity during a low point of extreme growth during the end of his teenage days. This growth transpired the birth of his true expression through audio and visual work.</p>
